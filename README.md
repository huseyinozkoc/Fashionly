## 🧩Description

The Fashionly project began as a way for me to utilize my weekends productively. Inspired by an impressive Figma design, I decided to bring it to life on Android using Jetpack Compose. This design-driven project involved breaking down the design into reusable components, meticulously building each one, and integrating them seamlessly to create a polished and functional app.

**You can access the Figma design link here:**
